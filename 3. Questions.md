3. How much was every delivery?

<details>

  <summary>Answer</summary>
  

```
The orders.price is always higher than recipe.price.
That is because orders.price includes the cost of the delivery.
To calculate exactly how much every customer paid for the delivery
we will deduct the recipe.price from every order.price and round the result. 
```
Code

```ruby

SELECT
  orders.id,
  ROUND(orders.price - recipe.price,2) AS DELIVERY_PRICE
FROM
  recipe
JOIN
  orders
ON
  recipe.id = orders.recipe_id;
